glimpse(nycflights)

#Create a Histrogram (each with a different bin width)

ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)

ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 150)

# Exercise 1

lax_flights <- nycflights |>
  filter(dest == "LAX")
ggplot(data = lax_flights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()
# Summary statistics: Some useful function calls for summary statistics for a single numerical variable:

lax_flights |>
  summarise(mean_dd   = mean(dep_delay), 
            median_dd = median(dep_delay), 
            n         = n())


### Exercise 2: Create a new data frame that includes flights headed to SFO in February, and save this data frame as sfo_feb_flights. How many flights meet these criteria?
#Answer is 68 flights

#filter function

sfo_feb_flights <- nycflights |>
  filter(dest == "SFO", month == 2)

View(sfo_feb_flights)

dim(sfo_feb_flights)

### Exercise 3 Describe the distribution of the arrival delays of these flights using a histogram and appropriate summary statistics. Hint: The summary statistics you use should depend on the shape of the distribution.

#Answer is Roughly bell shaped, though rightly skewed.

ggplot(data = sfo_feb_flights, aes(x = arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
